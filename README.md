# Presents

Presents is a fun plugin that allows you to send presents in good-styled boxes. It's useful for bringing communities together, giving love, etc. It's easy to use.

## How to use it?
* Craft a present with your favorite color.
* By right-clicking put some stuff into it (up to 27 slots)
* Hold the present and send it to an online player by typing /givepresent <Player>
* That's all. Now the player that you sent the present has to type /claimpresents to claim your present.

### Example:
GIF - Coming soon...

## Available commands:
* __/opencrafting__ - Opens a 4x4 crafting where you can craft items from this plugin.
* __/givepresent__ <Player> - Gives a present in your hand to an online player.
* __/claimpresents__ - Claims all presents you have.
