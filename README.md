# Presents

Presents is a fun plugin that allows you to send presents in good-styled boxes. It's useful for bringing communities together, giving love, etc. It's easy to use.

How to use it?
Craft a present with your favorite color.
By right-clicking put some stuff into it (up to 27 slots)
Hold the present and send it to an online player by typing /givepresent <Player>
That's all. Now the player that you sent the present has to type /claimpresents to claim your present.
Example:
GIF - Coming soon...
